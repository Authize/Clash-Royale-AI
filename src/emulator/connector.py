class EmulatorConnector:

	"""
	A platform-agnostic stub for integrating the trained agent with a mobile emulator.

	Responsibilities:
	- Capture screen frames from the emulator.
	- Convert frames + OCR/game-event hooks into the simulator-like observation dict.
	- Execute agent actions as emulator interactions (tap/drag at coordinates).

	You must implement platform-specific details (ADB, Win32 UI Automation, etc.)
	and ensure compliance with the game's and platform's terms of service.
